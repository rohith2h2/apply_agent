# Debugging Issues

Based on the logs and testing, here are the key issues that need to be addressed:

## API Endpoint Issues

Several API endpoints are returning 404 errors when requested by the web interface or Chrome extension:

```
2025-04-09 14:01:13,442 - werkzeug - INFO - 127.0.0.1 - - [09/Apr/2025 14:01:13] "GET /api/learning-sessions HTTP/1.1" 404 -
2025-04-09 14:01:13,451 - werkzeug - INFO - 127.0.0.1 - - [09/Apr/2025 14:01:13] "GET /api/learning-status HTTP/1.1" 404 -
2025-04-09 14:01:13,455 - werkzeug - INFO - 127.0.0.1 - - [09/Apr/2025 14:01:13] "GET /api/active-learning-session HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

And more critically:

```
2025-04-09 14:08:34,999 - werkzeug - INFO - 127.0.0.1 - - [09/Apr/2025 14:08:34] "POST /api/finish-learning HTTP/1.1" 404 -
2025-04-09 14:08:49,177 - werkzeug - INFO - 127.0.0.1 - - [09/Apr/2025 14:08:49] "POST /api/finish-learning HTTP/1.1" 404 -
2025-04-09 15:55:54,932 - werkzeug - INFO - 127.0.0.1 - - [09/Apr/2025 15:55:54] "POST /api/finish-learning HTTP/1.1" 404 -
2025-04-09 15:57:20,216 - werkzeug - INFO - 127.0.0.1 - - [09/Apr/2025 15:57:20] "POST /api/finish-learning HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

The `/api/finish-learning` endpoint is defined in the UI app.py file but isn't being correctly registered or is encountering an error. This is causing the Chrome extension to be unable to complete the learning session.

## Integration Issues

While the `/api/start-learning` endpoint is working (status 200), the extension is failing to complete the session with `/api/finish-learning` (status 404).

This indicates a disconnect between:
1. The API endpoints defined in the code
2. The actual registered routes in the Flask application
3. The endpoints the Chrome extension is trying to access

## Data Storage

The system is intended to store session data in:
- The browser's local storage (via the Chrome extension)
- The Flask application's memory
- Persistently on disk 

The error with the finish-learning endpoint means data isn't being properly saved to disk.

## Action Items

1. **Fix API Endpoints**: Ensure all API endpoints defined in ui/app.py are properly registered with the Flask application.
2. **Debug Route Registration**: Check Flask application startup and route registration.
3. **Test API Endpoints**: Create a simple test script to verify all API endpoints are accessible.
4. **Fix Chrome Extension Integration**: Ensure the Chrome extension is using the correct URLs for API endpoints.
5. **Resolve Data Storage**: Confirm data paths and permissions for writing session data to disk.

## Testing Notes

The test form at http://localhost:8000/test_form.html has been successfully used to submit test data, but the learning sessions aren't being completed and saved because of the API endpoint issues.
